<h1>Linus Torvalds</h1>
<img src="Linus.jpg">
<h2>Born December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland.</h2>
<h2>Still alive today at 49 years old</h2>
<p1> Linus is mainly revered for two <b><i>very</i></b> big contributions: <b>Linux</b> and <b>Git</b>.
 Linux is an open source operating system and the tools that operate alongside it.
 The tools are not always used, but the operating system kernel is the most widely used open source
 operating system in the world. 
<br>
<i>“Depending on which user survey you look at, between one- and two-thirds of the webpages on the Internet are
 generated by servers running Linux”</i> . 
Linux is very customizable; because of this and its open source attribute, Linux is very good for security, 
thus is run on many servers, as well as other devices. Based on Unix, Linux was named by combining Unix, and the ‘L’ from Linus.
 “Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development” . 
Git is designed for teams, groups, companies, etc. to be able to work on a project and easily see version control. 
This means they who makes what changes and where, as well as easily keep the team up-to-date on development and the latest version. 
Git is, also, used as a repository for code. I, personally, have used it to store old projects and code in private repositories, 
just about every person who deals with code will end up using Git at some point in time. </p1>
