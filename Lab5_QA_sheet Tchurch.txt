Complete this answer sheet using the instructions given in the lab. Submit an electronic file containing the answers to Blackboard by the due date of the lab. All questions are worth 1/2 point, with the exception of question 17 (the last question) which is worth 2 points.

Compiling
1) Write the size (in bytes) of the executable _8848_ (Note: The size in bytes is the number immediately before the date in the output from the ls -l command)

2) Now, recompile using the -g command line option and write the size in bytes of the new executable: __11624__________

Starting GDB
3) Copy the first line that is printed when you run gdb: GNU gdb (GDB) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6.1-114.el7

4) Now, copy the portion in the quotes on the line that states "This GDB was configured as." For instance, in the example above, you would copy i686-linux-gnu: _______x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu_____

Getting Help
5) Write the number of topics/classes: ____12_____

6) Now, type "help break" to get specific information:
Write the first line printed after executing the command here: _Set breakpoint at specified line or function.

Running a Program
7) Try it now. What happened? ____debug info didn't match, mode 1 mode 2_____

8) Try the run command again, this time adding "1" (without quotes) to the command line. What happened this time? ___same debug info, then Sum of Integers from 0 to 10 is: 1013 ___________

Setting Breakpoints
9) At what line number does execution pause? __________55__
A Brief Digression
10) Write what you see as a result: ________$1=1___________

Stepping Through Code
11) Use the print statement mentioned above to print the current value of sum. What is its current value? __0____________

12) Now, use the step command step over the current line. At what line does the execution pause? __for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)____________

13) Print the value of sum again. What is its value now? __0_______

14) Continue stepping through the program until the following line is reached:
sum += sum + i;

15) Print the value of sum: ___26(I've gone through the loop a few times)______

Displaying Variables
16) What is the value of the variable 'i' at this point? ____5_________

17) Once you see what the bug(s) is/are, describe it/them below (2 points):
Instead of sum += i; the program has sum+= sum+i; Adding sum extra times.
