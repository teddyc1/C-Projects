The questions on this sheet should be answered as you progress through Lab 4. They are given in the original order of the main Lab 4 document. Use the original documentation for Lab 4, but write the answers to the questions on this sheet. You will submit a soft copy of this sheet as part of your lab submission. Therefore, you may wish to copy and paste this answer sheet to an ASCII text editor, write your answers directly into the editor, and then save the file. NOTE: Do not use any non-ASCII file formats (like Word or ODS format).

It is important that you follow this narrative carefully, and avoid any shortcuts in this lab. The answers to many of the questions you will be given depend upon properly completing the lab in the sequence presented.

Note: This lab must be completed on zeus using the gcc compiler. Compilers on other systems (mason.gmu.edu, your personal linux machine, Microsoft Visual C++ or XCode) may not give the same results. The TA will be looking for specific answers for the grading of this lab and the use of other compilers may result in incorrect answers.

Step #0:

Step #1:
How many errors appear? _3_
How many warnings appear?_1__


Step #2:

Step #3:
Run the program, and at the prompt, enter the value 10.
What happens? ______Segmentation Fault_______________

What value is printed after “The sum of integers 0 to 10 is: “ ? _10_
What value *should* have been printed? ___55___
How many warnings appear without the -Wall option? ____0___
How many warnings appear with the -Wall option?  _____1____


Step #4:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? ___1__
List in order the values output by the printf statement you added: _______i = 10, sum = 10____________


Answer the following questions again, based on the most recent code execution:

            How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? __1______
List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added:
____________10_____________
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? __10__


Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input). Did the "statement with no effect" warning message go away? _______

Now answer the following questions:

          How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? _1_
List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added:
_______10_____________________
What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? __10__


Comment out the for loop, and copy it to the line below, this time without the semicolon.
Compile and run the program again (using 10 as input). Now answer the questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 10__
List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added:
_____0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45______________

What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? __45____
Is the final value of sum correct? (Look at your answer to step #3 above) __no____


You are supposed to add the integers from 0 to 10. Which integer is missing? _10___

Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input):
Answer the following questions:
How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? _11__
List in order the numerical values of sum output by the printf statement you added:
___0,1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36,45,55_______

What is the value of sum output by the program in the final statement? ___55___


Step #5:
Recompile, and run the code. Has the output changed? __errors because sum isn't initialized anymore._________

Step #6: If you haven't already, create an electronic version of this page. You can either keep it as html, or copy it to a text file. Fill out the answer sheet with the responses you recorded as you went through the lab. Then submit this document using Blackboard.
